//! Intel XED Bindings.
//!
//! For the real docs see: <https://intelxed.github.io>
//!
//! Note that [`xed_tables_init()`][0] must be called before using the library.
//!
//! # Features
//! - `bindgen` - Don't use the bundled bindings files and instead regenerate
//!   rust bindings from scratch at compile time. You should never need to
//!   enable this manually but it will be enabled by other features.
//! - `dylib` - Link XED (and `enc2` libraries if enabled) dynamically. This
//!   allows you to work around the link errors that prevent you from linking
//!   both enc2 libraries statically.
//!
//! ## `enc2`
//! XED has the option to enable its [`enc2`][1] encoder. This contains a
//! function to generate an x86 instruction for _every single instruction
//! variant_. As such, it is slow to compile and running bindgen on the
//! resulting headers generates a mountain (20+MB) of rust code.
//!
//! The generated static libraries also unfortunately have some duplicate
//! symbols so attempting to link both will result in linker errors. To make
//! the error less confusing this library will fail to compile if both
//! `enc2-m64-a64` and `enc2-m32-a32` are enabled and the `dylib` feature is
//! not enabled.
//!
//! - `enc2-m64-a64` - Enable enc2 for 64-bit mode with 64-bit addresses.
//! - `enc2-m32-a32` - Enable enc2 for 32-bit mode with 32-bit addresses.
//! - `enc2-chk` - Enable checked variants of the of the enc2 functions. Note
//!   that this feature does nothing unless you have enabled one of the other
//!   enc2 features.
