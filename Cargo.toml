[features]
# Enable the enc2 module of XED.
#
# Each feature enables a version of enc2 for a different module and operand
# size. Note that attempting to enable multiple enc2 feature variants is not
# supported and will result in a compile error (instead of the link error it
# would normally emit).

# Generate bindings with bindgen at build-time instead of using the
# pregenerated bindings.

# This will be slower but is required for certain feature combinations.
